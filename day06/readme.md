The file "Statistics_data.xlsx" is a part of a statistics assignment inteded to demonstrate the CLT.
It includes 10,000 random samples sets with n=30 taken from a skewed population.
"excel_CLT.py" is a code that calculates the mean, variance and median for each sample set. 
afterwards it plots the histogram of the values for each paramter separately,
showing a relatively normal distriution for the mean and median, but not for the variance.

The "test_Statistics_data.xlsx" file contains only the first sample set from the file "Statistics_data.xlsx".
"test_excel_CLT.py" checks if the function calculated the expected mean, variance and median correctly.
